Vocabular is a mobile/web app that helps learning Vocabulary.
Visit it at: https://focccus.github.io/vocabular/

## Features

The app is structured like Vocabulary Boxes. You can create infinitly many boxes that act as a collection of Vocabulary Pairs.
In the settings you can change the language, how many compartments the box has and more.

- You can quickly enter Vocabs after each other.
- Optionally you can enable Declensions for each box and learn them with the translation.
- The app will suggest Vocabs you already entered and use MyMemory translations as suggestions.
- With the Trainer you can learn your vocabs. Words go through multiple stages depending on success. You can learn the weakest performing the most.
- You can decide if the word was correct or not or input it with your keyboard and let the app check it automatically.
- The App uses String similarity, so slight spelling mistakes, uppercase and hyphens are ignored. The goal is to learn the words not the exact input.
- Once finished with learning, you can test your knowledge. The App will evaluate the answers, calculate mistakes and gives you statistics on your grade.
- The app supports multiple grade types: American, German, Points.
- You can fully customize the color scheme.
- The app has dark mode
- Add new languages to learn.
- You can browse all your words in all boxes and search for specific words.
- Share your Boxes by exporting and importing `.vocab` files. Your friends can use the same words that you learn!
- The app uses no external server, service or ads. Everything you do is kept on device.
- Responsive. Use the app on all screen sizes and devices.

This app was made with Material Design in Flutter. It uses HiveDB to store vocabs locally.
